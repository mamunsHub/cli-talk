## CLI Talk

### Pre-face
This talk was all about making you (the audience) interested in CLI and terminal. And how CLI or terminal doesn't have to be scary and geeky stuff. 

I have not given detailed tutorial on any of the stuffs I talked about. But I cerntainly hope you look it up while using it.

### Presentation
The [presentation](cli-presentation/out.pdf) was made using [remarkjs](https://remarkjs.com/) a markdown based presentation tools. Just to show its possible to make simple and beautiful presentation by writing code only. 
Source is availeable under [cli-presentation](cli-presentation) directory.

### Using CLI / Terminal
Using terminal and becoming familiar with is absolutely about usage. You have to use it everyday and for everything to grow muscle memory for stuffs you use on your work. Therefore your terminal may look and feel completely and utterly different me. While the underlying principal leaves the scope for either of us to get our work done. 


### Some talks about "THE TALK"
I hoped to cover so many more. I had like 5/6 pages of notes about stuffs I wanted to cover. Although I couldn't here are some stuffs that needs mentions - 

> Better late than never.

* Here is a fantastic talk on why you should make a CLI first for your project idea. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qLNrcYkQiY&t=927s)
* Most famous and used package managers for developers and users are written for CLI. for example `apt` (for debian) `pacman` (for arch) `npm` (node). Even windows is building a centralized package manager with CLI first. 
* For you mobile geeks who complains how can I run this C code or Python code in android without a cloud IDE or an app showing advertisement? Install [termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux) and install gcc/python or whatever you need. And run your code on your mobile, if you are desperate. 
* Downloading youtube video can be troublesome right? Use [youtube-dl](http://yt-dl.org/) on both android (tmux) or in your system download video without inconvenience. 

> There were a few other tricks and tips I forgot. Maybe I will add them later.
